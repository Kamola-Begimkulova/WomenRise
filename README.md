WomenRise 🌸

WomenRise is a multi-page web platform that empowers women through skill-sharing workshops, a creator marketplace, and a supportive community + dashboard experience.

🧠 About the project 
WomenRise focuses on building a modern, attractive, real-product-style UI with smooth interactions and multiple pages.  
It was created to practice front-end architecture, responsive design, UI/UX patterns (filters, modals, drawers), and JavaScript logic.
